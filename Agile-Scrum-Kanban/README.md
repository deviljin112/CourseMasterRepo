# Agile-Scrum-Kanban

## 4 Principles

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

## Agile

Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development that helps teams deliver value to their customers faster and with fewer headaches. Instead of betting everything on a "big bang" launch, an agile team delivers work in small, but consumable, increments. Requirements, plans, and results are evaluated continuously so teams have a natural mechanism for responding to change quickly.

### How to implement

1. The highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development
3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months
4. Stakeholders and developers must collaborate on a daily basis
5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
6. Face-to-face meetings are deemed the most efficient and effective format for project success
7. A final working product is the ultimate measure of progress
8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility
10. Simplicity—maximizing the work not done—is an essential element
11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams
12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly

## Scrum

A scrum framework allows teams to create multiple boards for each team. These boards would have a global epic that they would follow. While each team would have their own interpretations of the user stories that they will fullfil to complete an Epic.

Because of the nature of Epic and User Stories, scrum is an essential part of a successful implementation. Scrum has an explicit timeboxed interation called Sprints. This therefore allows a team to organise short weekly sprints which can be broken down to user story implementations. Scrum also is helpful at establishing a simple hierachy in a product backlog. This is useful for a good implementation of Epics and focusing each team at task at hand.

### 3 Amigos

- Business – What problem are we trying to solve?
- Development – How might we build a solution to solve that problem?
- Testing – What about this, what could possibly happen?

## Scrum Roles

### Scrum Master

Scrum Master ensures everyone follows the practices prescribed by Scrum.

- A Scrum Master is a facilitator and Servant Leader who encourages and demands self-organization from the development team.
- A Scrum Master enables close cooperation across all roles and functions, addresses resource issue and disobedience of scrum practices.
- A Scrum Master protects the team from external and internal distractions.
- A Scrum Master removes impediments so the team can focus on the work at hand and follow scrum practices.
- A Scrum Master is not typically a manager or lead, but he is an influential leader and coach who does not do direct command and control.

### Product Owner

Product Owner in Agile is like a spokesperson for customer and needs to represent them,

- A Product Owner owns the Product backlog and writes user stories and acceptance criteria.
- A Product Owner is responsible for prioritizing the Product Backlog is prioritized and decides the release date and the content.
- A Product Owner accepts or rejects product backlog item.
- A Product Owner has the power to cancel the Sprint, if he thinks the Sprint goal is redundant.
- A Product Owner is the one who is responsible for the Return on Investment (ROI) of the product.

### Development Team

This could include software engineers, architects, programmers, analysts, system admins, QA experts, testers, UI designers, etc.

- The Development Team builds the product that the Product Owner indicates: the application or website, for example. The Team in Scrum is “cross-functional”
- The Development Team includes all the expertise necessary to deliver the potentially shippable product each Sprint
- The Development Team is self-organizing, with a very high degree of autonomy and accountability.
- The Development Team decides how many items to build in a Sprint, and how best to accomplish that goal.
- The Development Team is a cross functional, small and self-organizing team which owns the collective responsibility of developing, testing and releasing the Product increment.
- The Development Team may not appoint any team lead since decisions are taken collectively by the team.

## Scrum Artifacts

### Product Backlog

The Product Backlog is an ordered list of everything that is known to be needed in a product. It is constantly evolving and is never complete.

### Sprint Backlog

The Sprint Backlog is a list of everything that the team commits to achieve in a given Sprint. Once created, no one can add to the Sprint Backlog except the Development Team.

If the Development Team needs to drop an item from the Sprint Backlog, they must negotiate it with the Product Owner. During this negotiation, the ScrumMaster should work with the Development Team and Product Owner to try to find ways to create some smaller increment of an item rather than drop it altogether.

### Potentially Releasable Product Increment

At the end of every Sprint, the team must complete a product increment that is potentially releasable, meaning that meets their agreed-upon definition of done. (An example might be fully tested and fully approved.)

## Scrum Ceremonies

### Sprint Planning Meeting

The goal of Sprint Planning is to answer the questions “What are we going to work on, and how are we going to do it?” It’s also important for the team to have a shared goal and a shared commitment to this goal before beginning their Sprint – the list of items the team plans to work on during that specific Sprint. The team then breaks down these items into tasks, typically no bigger than a 2 days’ worth of work.

### Daily Stand-up Meeting

Once we begin a Sprint, we have what we call a Daily Scrum every day. Organized by the Scrum Master, Daily Scrum is typically a 15-minute stand-up meeting to synchronize the work of team members, i.e. what’s done on the prior day, what needs to be done today, identify any impediments, and creates visibility around the work that everyone is doing in the Sprint.

### Sprint Review Meeting

Held at the end of each sprint to demonstrate the added functionality. The goal is to get feedback from the product owner and other stakeholders to ensure that the delivered increment met the business need and to revise the Product Backlog based on the feedback. This feedback will then become items that will be looped back into the Product Backlog, where it can be ordered and pulled in by the team in a future Sprint.

### Sprint Retrospective Meeting

Retrospectives typically last 90 minutes and are there to help us incorporate continuous improvement into our team culture and into our Sprint cadence. This is where the Scrum Team meets to reflect on their previous Sprint and to figure out how to improve as a team by asking – what went well, what did not and what can be improved. It allows the team to focus on its overall performance and identify strategies for continuous improvement.

## Epics and User Stories

### Epic

An agile epic is a block of work that can be broken down into smaller more specific tasks, these tasks are called "user stories". These tasks are also based on the customer needs.

An agile epic usually involved multiple teams working on multiple projects often tracked by multiple boards.

Epics are delivered over a multiple sprints and as the team discovers need challenges and needs user stories will be added or removed as required.

Key elements of an Agile Epic:

- Flexible Scope
- Based on customer feedback
- Teamwork and communication
- Continous adaptation of user stories

Guidelines for defining an Epic:

- A story that is longer than 8 story points
- A story that cant be completed in one sprint

#### Example

A company does a project. This project has to be fullfilled by multiple departments coordinating together. This project would be considered an Epic, as each story is aimed at fullfilling the main Epic. Its important that each team supports each other for an epic to be completed

### User Story

An agile user story is a general explanation of a feature seen from the perspective of the end user. The core idea is that this will feature is aimed at providing value to the client. These are usually the smaller elements that when combined together create an Epic. Each team would have its own set of stories for the global epic.

User stories put the client as the driver of the project, making the development mold and adapt to their requirements and needs. These stories provide user-focused framework for work which drives collaboration, creativity as well as quality of the end product.

Key elements:

- why building the project
- what needs to be built
- what value it creates

#### Example 2

Multiple teams are working on a project. The client asks that they want X Y Z functionality in their software as this will allow them to be more efficient (for example). These X Y Z conditions would be considered a story together with the reasoning for why they should be created. As the client is after efficiency the team knows what they need to keep in mind while fullfilling the requirements.

### Poker Planning

Planning poker (also known as Scrum poker) is a consensus-based, gamified technique for estimating, mostly used to estimate effort or relative size of development goals in software development.

### Invest

A good user story should be:

- “I” ndependent (of all others)
- “N” egotiable (not a specific contract for features)
- “V” aluable (or vertical)
- “E” stimable (to a good approximation)
- “S” mall (so as to fit within an iteration)
- “T” estable (in principle, even if there isn’t a test for it yet)

## Kanban

Kanban is a popular framework used to implement agile software development. It requires real-time communication of capacity and full transparency of work. Work items are represented visually on a kanban board, allowing team members to see the state of every piece of work at any time.

### Kanban vs Scrum

- Scrum and kanban are “agile by-the-books.” They work in a tried and true fashion that is quite frankly hard to argue against. Borrowing from another famed catch-phrase, you might say that, “No one gets fired for choosing scrum.”

- But your decision doesn't need to be so black and white. Hundreds of teams are using hybrid models influenced by both scrum and kanban. We set out to help teams do so in Jira Software and recently released next-gen projects.

- Next-gen projects allow teams to pick and choose the agile features that make sense for them; whether that's scrum, kanban, or a mix of both. Instead of implementing one framework on day one, next-gen projects allow you to progressively layer on more and more powerful features as you learn what works for your team (and what doesn't).

- You can confidently choose next-gen Scrum or next-gen Kanban knowing that both templates can evolve to suit the needs of your team.

- Regardless of what you choose, stick with it for a little while. Take some work from the backlog all the way to done and then ask your team what went well and what went poorly. By trying scrum and kanban and asking these questions, you're well on your way to agile bliss.
