# D3v & Farah Revision Session

## Coding (QUERY)

Attempt as many or as little as you want or feel like! The questions are in what I would consider correct difficulty but each person learns at different rates and probably finds different subjects harder or easier, so dont be discouraged by the difficulty if you cant do Easy but find "Hard" easier. It's just how I would label each of those tasks. If you don't understand a question, ask me or Farah to explain!
